# Find Appointment for Free Covid Vaccine on CoWin

Script helps you find the slot of free covid vaccine. There are limited shots of free vaccine and they get booked too soon.
The script keeps checking for available centers at the frequency which you can configure by setting up variables at the top and notifies you with a beep on windows.
It also logs everything to a file, so you can later on check logs and get the timings when the slot was available and be ready next day around the same time, assuming there's a pattern in uploading vaccine slots by Hospitals (it might just be random :( but still worth trying).

### Update variables at the top to pass your pincode etc

The script had helped me find the slot for my second shot :)
